Cat: Tch, loser.
->You don't have to be so mean everytime we talk.
    Cat: But watching you squirm in your boots is just so...
    Cat: It feels good.
    -> Well fuck you too, buddy.
        Cat: Yeah, that's what I thought. You don't have it in you to get through this dialogue tree.
        <<set $cat_patience = $cat_patience - 5>>
    -> I'm just trying to help out.
        Cat: Oh yeah, help with this then.

The cat stares at the forest.
-> Keep Pressing
    The cat looks at the floor.
    -> Keep Staring At Her
        The cat looks away from you, uncomfortably.
        -> Stare at her piercing, jade eyes...
            Cat: OKAY FUCK I GET IT.
            Cat: Peace out, weirdo.

The cat leaps into the trees, and vanishes into the forest. You hear a soft chuckles echo through the leaves.
-> She must have gotten impatient.
