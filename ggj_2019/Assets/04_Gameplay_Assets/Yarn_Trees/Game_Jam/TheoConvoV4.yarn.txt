Theo: I’m so screwed. 
Theo: I’m taking the SAT tomorrow but I’m here instead of studying. 
Theo: Idiot. 
Theo: You! Help me with these practice questions. Please!!!
    -> Sure!
        Sure!
        Theo: Thanks, you’re saving my future self!
        Theo: Ok here’s a question…
        Theo: Is this sentence correct? “Hunger is a problem that effects millions worldwide.” 
            ->Yes.
                Yes.
                Theo: No, it should be “affects!”
                Theo: Are you trying to destroy my future?! 
                Theo: First I fail the SAT. Then I don’t get into college. 
                Theo: Then my future wife divorces me for spending our life savings on idol gashapon mobile games.  
                (The SAT really sucks…)
                <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
            ->No.
                No.
                Theo: You’re totally right, it should be “affects”!
                Theo: Good eye new kid. 
                Theo: Thanks for helping me study at a party of all places.
                Theo: A lot of people wouldn’t have. 
                (He seems less stressed out now.)
                <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager 1>>
    -> No thanks.
        No thanks. 
        Theo: I understand, most people wouldn’t want to do SAT questions during a party… 
        (Oh no, he seems so sad…)

    Theo: My life is a series of terrible mistakes. 
    Theo: Can I please ask you an SAT question?
    -> Sure you can.
        Theo: You are saving my life.
        Theo: Alright, “What is the probability of drawing an Ace or King from a deck of cards?”
        -> 2/19 
            Theo: Did you just pull that number out of your ass?!
            Theo: Am I just a joke to you?!
            Theo: Sorry. I shouldn’t get so mad...
            Theo: I’m just...
            Theo: My family’s great failure!
            (Oh man, I really should have paid more attention in math class.)
            <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
        -> 1/13 
            Theo: That’s totally right!
            Theo: I thought I was doomed, but now…
            Theo: I am filled with hope!
            (Oh wow, I must have really paid attention in math class that day.)
            <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager 1>>
        -> 5/12 
            Theo: Did you just pull that number out of your ass?!
            Theo: Am I just a joke to you?!
            Theo: Sorry. I shouldn’t get so mad…
            Theo: I’m just...
            Theo: My family’s great failure!
            (Oh man, I really should have paid more attention in math class.)
            <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
    -> I really don’t want to.
        Theo: Of course, it’s a party.
        Theo: I should probably stop asking people questions.
        (Oh no! He looks even sadder than before!)

Theo: Sorry if I bothered you before.
Theo: It’s crazy to ask people SAT questions at a party.
Theo: I’ve just been so stressed.
Theo: I shouldn’t have come to this party but…
->But, there’s somebody here you wanted to see?

    ->The theater kid?
    	The theater kid?
        Theo: No, that’s Jeffery. I’m going to get back to studying.
        (I think I insulted him.)
        <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
    ->From the band?
    	From the band?
        Theo: The very one.
        ->You like him?
        	You like him?
            Theo: ….maybe…
            ->I could help you out.
            	I could help you out.
                Theo: You would really do that for me? Thanks so much!
                (I hope I can help him out!)
                <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager 1>>
            ->He seems really weird.
            	He seems really weird.
                Theo: Well thanks for your opinion.
                (I think I made him mad…)
                <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
            ->That’s really cool!
            	That’s really cool!
                 Theo: Well thanks I guess? I’m going to get back to studying.

    ->The party host? 
    	The party host? 
        Theo: No that’s Liam. Liam’s cool I guess, but not like that. I’m going to get back to studying.

->But you were afraid of missing out?
	But you were afraid of missing out?
    Theo: Sure I guess. Sorry I’m getting too distracted. I need to get back to studying.
     (I think he had something else on his mind.)
