            <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager -1>>
        -> Are you serious, it’s JoJo.

                Ace: A classic answer. For somebody who doesn’t know anything at all! Better luck next time.
                (His insults cut to my core…)

            -> I think it has to be Patumon.

            -> Why do you want to test my anime knowledge so bad?
                Why do you want to test my anime knowledge so bad?
                Ace: I just wanted to bond with people about my greatest passion, but maybe I was being too harsh. 
                Ace: Thanks for talking anime with me anyway, new kid. 
                (Once he finally stopped talking about anime, he seemed like a nice guy!)
