(Oh shit, her hair is so cool. And her shirt. And...wow she’s super cool.)
(I haven’t seen her before she must be in college or something.)
Rebecca: …

(I just...wanted to say something nice! Idiot. Uhhh, uhh, um.)

    Rebecca: ...are you hitting on me?
    -> Yes?
        Yes?
        Rebecca: Ugh, not in the mood, new kid.

        -> Yeah, I think so.

    -> You’re not weird.
        You're not weird.
    Rebecca: Ha! Thanks new kid.
    Rebecca: Listen, if anyone fucks with you, let me know.
    Rebecca: I’ve got dirt on ALL of them, hahaha.
    (She’s so cool!!!)
