Hazel: C’mon, don’t be such a stick in the mud! 
Hazel: You’re new, and this party is the perfect chance to meet people. 
Hazel: Besides, you already came all this way.
-> You forced me to come, dude. (Select with Z key.)
You forced me to come, dude.
Hazel: If you keep up with that attitude, you’re gonna have no confidence. 
Hazel: You’ll just be a sad little worm. Nobody likes a sad little worm. 
-> A sad little worm sounds kind of cute… 
Hazel: STOP…
-> ...Fine, you’re right.  But I’m not happy about it.
Fine, you’re right.  But I’m not happy about it.
Hazel: That’s the spirit! Now, you need to talk to that cute girl, Ivy, from science class.
-> ...Do you really think I can…? 
...Do you really think I can…?
Hazel: Sure I do! Just walk up an press Z, just like with anyone else!

Hazel: ...Well, you might need to work up your confidence first. Go meet some people, and when you're feeling good enough, just talk to her.
Hazel: But I believe in you. Because you have the most important thing--
Hazel: Hold that thought. My girlfriend’s calling me. 
Hazel: Uhhh… 
Hazel: Good luck! 

(She’s right, I should make friends here, but it’s so hard to talk to new people.)
(I wish I was home.)
