Liam: Hey, new kid! Hope you’re having a good time at my party! I worked really hard on it.
-> Well, I just got here, but it’s going alright!
    Well, I just got here, but it’s going alright!
-> To be honest, I’m still too nervous to talk to anyone.
    To be honest, I’m still too nervous to talk to anyone.
Liam: Hey, if you’re feeling a little anxious, I could get you a drink?
-> I could use a confidence booster… 
    I could use a confidence booster…
    Liam: No problem, I gotchu! 
    Liam: I stocked the fridge, so help yourself. Just make sure you pace yourself.
-> No thanks, I don’t want to start seeing double or anything… 
    No thanks, I don’t want to start seeing double or anything…
    Liam: No problem! Actually, I don’t drink myself! 
    Liam: Like, at all. 
    Liam: But if you do end up wanting one, no judgement! Just remember to pace yourself.
(I’m a little nervous.)
(I’ve never had a drink before.)
(Maybe I’ll have one if I really need the confidence to talk to somebody intimidating.)

Liam: Hey again, new kid! Feeling any better? 
Liam: Hey, I haven’t had much of a chance to talk to you at school yet. 
Liam: You making friends? It’s important to have friends.

    Oh yeah, it’s cool, I have, like, a million friends!
    Liam: Oh, nice. You must be way cooler than me. When I hit ninth grade I couldn’t make friends for like, months.    
-> It’s...kinda hard to make new friends, actually.
    It’s...kinda hard to make new friends, actually.
    Liam: I totally understand. Hey, listen, for real. You see me at school, say hi. I got your back.
Liam: What do you do for fun though? 
Liam: My dad and I are big Sasquatch fans, we go to all the games. School spirit!
(I didn’t even know we had a school football team. God, I know nothing about sports...)
    -> Oh yeah, I’m such a fan! I love our… um, defensive line?
        Oh yeah, I’m such a fan! I love our… um, defensive line?
        Liam: Defensive…? Um, the Sasquatches are our basketball team, not football.
        Liam: ... Hey, it’s okay if you don’t like sports, new kid. You don’t have to be, like, dishonest...
        Liam: Well anyway! I gotta make sure everybody’s drink are all fresh and shit. Catch ya later, okay?
        (He’s still being so nice to me even though I was being so weird. I feel awkward.)

        I’m not a sports fan.
        Liam: That’s alright, new kid. I’m mostly into it to spend time with my Dad. 
        Liam: You do you!
        Liam: Hey, I gotta mingle some more, but hit me up at school and tell me what you’re into!
        (He’s really making an effort to get to know me!)

Liam: Talking to so many people is really exhausting right?
Liam: I’m sure it’s even harder for you, you just moved here. 
Liam: What was your old town like?
-> It was really small and cute.
-> It was really big and exciting.
-> It was fine.
Liam: Do you miss it?
-> Yeah.
-> Nah.
Liam: Well, I’m glad you’re here.
-> I’m glad I’m here too.
    Liam: You’re surprising new kid. In a good way. I’m glad we’re friends.
    (I’m glad we’re friends too.)
    <<AddConfidencePoints GameManager 1>>
-> I’m not.
    Liam: I’m sorry to hear that. I hope you have a good night. 
    (I think I really hurt his feelings.)
